# Flourish

Quick tool for driving a Chrome browser over random link on a site (uses Wikipedia as coded, but easily changed by editing the `BASE_URL` constant).

## Usage

First `brew tap homebrew/cask && brew cask install chromedriver` on Mac or install the chromedriver for your platform.

`bundle` to install the required gems.

`bundle exec ruby flourish.rb` and use key presses to control the script.
